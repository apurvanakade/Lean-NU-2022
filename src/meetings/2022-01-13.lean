-- Goal: Let A be the adjacency matrix of a simple graph G. Show that the i,j-th entry of A is the number of paths from the vertex v_i to the vertex v_j in G.

-- Note: In Lean, there is some confusion between walk and path. In the above theorem, vertices and edges are allowed to repeat in the path.
